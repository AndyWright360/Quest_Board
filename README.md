## **User Experience (UX)**

### **Initial Concept**

The vision behind this project was to develop a website that could foster a community of Dungeons & Dragons players in South Wales. The primary objective was to design a platform that serves as an entry point for newcomers while simultaneously delivering value to more experienced players. To achieve this, the website was crafted with a user-friendly interface, ensuring easy navigation and allowing users to effortlessly create and participate in events.

From a visual perspective, the goal was to theme the website on the fantastical elements of Dungeons & Dragons. The design concept draws from the idea of quests being posted on a message board for adventurers.
